I was first a student teaching assistant and then a graduated teaching assistant at the Physics Department of the Universidad de Buenos Aires (DF-UBA), where I taught the following courses:

- **General Relativity**.
- **Statistical Mechanics**.
- **Quantum Mechanics**.
- **Classical Mechanics**.
- **Electrodynamics**.

Finally, I was a professor at Universidad Abierta Interamericana (UAI), where I taught courses on basic physics and maths.
