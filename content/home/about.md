I am a researcher in theoretical high-energy physics. After defending my doctoral thesis in Argentina and spending most last year as a PhD student as a visitor at the IoP-UvA in Amsterdam  and at the IPhT-CEA in Paris-Saclay I will soon be a postdoc at the University of Southampton.   

I am interested in the description of high-energy phenomena and strongly coupled physics by using  quantum field theory, string theory and holography.
My thesis focused on studying the internal structure of hadrons through the holographic dual description of the Deep Inelastic Scattering process.

Besides my research, teaching is one of my passions. I have had the pleasure to be a TA at the University of Buenos Aires, where I taught several advanced undergrad courses such as General Relativity, Classical, Statistical and Quantum Mechanics.

See you around!
